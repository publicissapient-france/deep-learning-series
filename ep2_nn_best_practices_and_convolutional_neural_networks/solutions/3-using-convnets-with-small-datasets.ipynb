This will get us to a classification accuracy of 71%. At that point, our main issue will be overfitting.

    "\n",
    "You will sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available. This is in part a valid point: one fundamental characteristic of deep learning is that it is able to find interesting features in the training data on its own, without any need for manual feature engineering, and this can only be achieved when lots of training examples are available. This is especially true for problems where the input samples are very high-dimensional, like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what constitutes \"lots\" of samples is relative -- relative to the size and depth of the network you are trying to train, for starters. It isn't possible to train a convnet to solve a complex problem with just a few tens of samples, but a few hundreds can potentially suffice if the model is small and well-regularized and if the task is simple. Because convnets learn local, translation-invariant features, they are very data-efficient on perceptual problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will still yield reasonable results \n",
    "despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any custom feature engineering. You will see this in action in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's more, deep learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can take, say, an image classification or speech-to-text model trained on a large-scale dataset then reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes. Specifically, in the case of computer vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet dataset) are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap powerful vision models out of very little data. That's what we will do in the next section.\n",
