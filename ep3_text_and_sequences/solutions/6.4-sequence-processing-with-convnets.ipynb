One way to evidence this weakness is to try 1D convnets on the temperature forecasting problem from the previous section, where order-sensitivity was key to produce good predictions. Let's see:"

Since more recent datapoints should be interpreted differently from older datapoints in the case of this specific forecasting problem, the convnet fails at producing meaningful results here.
